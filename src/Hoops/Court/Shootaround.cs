    /// Street Golf does them.
    ///
    /// THE THROW IS FREE. The aim is where the camera looks. Hold the button and the meter runs
    /// up and back down, and the line out of his hand stretches with it -- from a lob at his feet
    /// to a heave forty metres down the street. The line fades out before it comes down, so it
    /// gives the idea and never the spot. Nothing works a basket out for him and nothing steers
    /// the ball at the hoop: Michael asked for it that way, "if you wanted to throw it really far
    /// you could, dont try and make it swosh".
    ///
    /// A BASKET IS THE BALL DOWN THROUGH THE HOOP'S RING. Each hoop has a flat ring where its rim
    /// is, and the ball's middle has to come down through it. The hoops are built into the map,
    /// so the game will not say where they are, and reading the backboards with rays found
    /// neither of this court's -- the log of 2026-09-26 -- so the balls went in through a guess.
    /// The rings are placed by hand on the court instead (the developer tools, D-pad right with
    /// the ball) and written into RingAt for everybody else.
    ///
    /// THE SHOT is both hands pushing the ball up from the chest -- the up half of Raise the Roof,
    /// played quick and cut after the one push, on the arms only: no jump. The game has no
    /// basketball of its own and no clip of anybody shooting one; that is the nearest thing to it.
    /// Held, he carries the ball in the ball-game idle that goes with it.
