    /// shown, and whether something else has the player's attention. Each mod fills these in once,
    /// as it starts.

    /// Nothing in Court\ reaches past this for anything of its host's. The moment one file there
    /// names a host class, the copy stops compiling in the other mod -- which is the point: two
    /// hand-kept copies of one game drift, and a sync that only renames cannot.

    /// Every default is safe on its own: a court whose host set nothing still plays, just with
    /// nothing logged, nothing remembered and its labels in English.
